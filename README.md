<b> Hospital Data Analysis </b>

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anish94/Hospital_data_analysis/master?filepath=USA-hospital-data-analysis.ipynb)

The dataset contains information of hospitals across the United States. Key attributes observed are Hospital Type, Hospital Ownership and Hospital Rating. I have developed a dashboard using concepts taught in the Data Vizualization class to explore this dataset for the aformentioned attributes and derive useful insights from the same. 

The first dashboard viz links the map of USA with the Hospital Type based on the state selected. The user can click on a state and view the number of Hospitals based on Hospital Type in the bar chart on the right of the map. Right now, this works fine except one bug. The state selected needs to be deselected before selecting any other state. I am working on this issue and will fix it before the next submission.

The second viz links a dropdown with State abbreviations and a bar chart containing Hospital count and Hospital Type. User can select the state name and view its number of Hospitals based on Hospital Type. I have show this viz again as a substitute to above viz which contains a bug.

Third viz links a dropdown with State abbreviations and a bar chart contining Hospital count and Hospital Ownership. User can select the state name and view its number of Hospitals based on Hospital Ownership.
